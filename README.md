# Shopping List App written with React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## NPM packages

This app requires the following packages to run (except from React itself):
- JSON Server: `npm install -g json-server`
- React Router DOM: `npm install react-router-dom`


## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Before running Dev server

Since the `node_modules` file is not inclued in the repository, first run `npm i` and only after that `ng serve`.

## Angular packages

The following Angular packages may need to be installed in order to run the app: `ng add @angular/material`, `ng add @angular/forms`.

## Browser support
The app has been tested in current versions of Chrome, Firefox and Safari. While the app works fine in Chrome and Firefox, the user-search functionality needs some debugging in **Safari**.
